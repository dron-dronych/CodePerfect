Learning to write quality code together

- The place where i collect and list good coding principles and supply collections of good resources to learn that
- Covers universally accepted principles independent of a language though samples from C++, Python, and Java will be here for practical reasons


Code is more often read than written. I definitely agree with that as we all first read a lot of our own code, and then as we mature on software engineering - we inevitbaly read a lot of the others' code. So, why not make this reading process a pleasant activity for everyone?

**Good code code should speak for itself** bringing in this concept of self-documenting code where much of the explanation what the code does comes from the actual proper namings: constants, variables, classes, methods & functions, modules & packages.

### Standards: a way for beginners
I share the opinion that for beginners it is best to stick to the widely accepted standards, e.g. Python's PEP8 or Java's standards and common practices.
### Your project standards
Many teams have a bit of their own flavor and understanding what makes a good code for their particular project.
### Framework-imposed styles
Frameworks impose their own code-writing style; what may be excessive in naming, for example, may in fact be an accepted practice within a particular framework itself.
