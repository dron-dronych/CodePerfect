Learning to write quality code together

- The place where i collect and list good coding principles and supply collections of good resources to learn that



Code is more often read than written. I definitely agree with that as we all first read a lot of our own code, and then as we mature on software engineering - we inevitbaly read a lot of the others' code. So, why not make this reading process a pleasant activity for everyone?

**Good code code should speak for itself** bringing in this concept of self-documenting code where much of the explanation what the code does comes from the actual proper namings: constants, variables, classes, methods & functions, modules & packages.
